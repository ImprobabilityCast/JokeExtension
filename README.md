## Current Shenanigans
* Randomly redirects all YouTube videos to one of these: nyan cat, crab rave, rick roll.
  It works with embedded YouTube videos, with one caveat: the video owners can disallow embedding. For example, the rick roll cannot be embedded, so you may see a "Video Unavailable" message if it's replacing an embedded video.
* Creates spelling errors on every website.
